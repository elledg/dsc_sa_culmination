            <h1>Basic Info</h1>
            <p>Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There are more than 30 species around the world, and while they live in many different environments, they have many things in common.</p>
            <p>Rabbits and hares are in the same taxonomic family, Leporidae, but they are in different genera. There are 11 genera within the family, but the term “true hares” refers only to species in the genus Lepus; all others are rabbits. Also, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) recognizes 49 rabbit breeds.</p>
            <h2>Size</h2>
            <p>Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. Small rabbits, such as pygmy rabbits, can be as little as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in length and weigh less than a pound. Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms). </p>
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat. Their diets include grasses, clover and some cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are opportunistic feeders and also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and tree bark, according to ADW.</p>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>While originally from Europe and Africa, rabbits are now found all over the world. They occupy most of the world’s land masses, except for southern South America, the West Indies, Madagascar, and most islands southeast of Asia, according to ADW. Although originally absent from South America, Australia, New Zealand, Java, rabbits have been introduced to these locations during the last few centuries.</p>
            <p>Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. </p>
            <p>Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. Warrens can be as deep as 9.84 feet (3 meters) underground, according to the Young People's Trust for the Environment.</p>
            <h2>Habits</h2>
            <p>Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators.</p>
            <p>Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.</p>
            <h2>Rabbits as Pets</h2>
            <p>Rabbits are very tame and not demanding. They can be trained to learn commands and play games even be trained to use a litter box. Rabbits make very little noise so bothering your neighbors will not be a concern. Rabbits love to be handled, like attention, and tend to be active when most people are home. Because of all these attributes they can make an excellent pet.</p>

            <h1>Rabbits are not hares</h1>
            <p>Hares and rabbits are in the same family, Leporidae, but they're different species. Hares are larger, have longer ears, and are less social than rabbits. Hares live completely aboveground, lacking the normal burrow or warren system of rabbits. Hares also have a very unique skull. In addition to its distinct shape, hares have a kinetic skull that allows for movement between some of the bones that make up the skull. Rabbits and hares have different tendencies when they are faced with a predator. Hares will try to run. Rabbits will try to hide. Hares are very isolated animals and spend most of their time alone. They live above ground and fend for themselves. </p>
